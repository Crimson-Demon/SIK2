# SIK2

Repo for big project in computer network programming.
It is a simplified server-client application for Netacka:
* The server-client communication uses UDP.
* The client-gui communication uses TCP.

The description of the whole project is relatively long and in polish, thus it'll be attached as an auxilliary file for those more interested.
